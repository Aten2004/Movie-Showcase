# Movie Showcase Website using TMDB API - Built with HTML/CSS/JS

Hi there!  
This is a movie showcase website I built from scratch as a personal project to practice HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no backend. It fetches data from the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API and displays trending movies, TV shows, and animations.

I designed this site to be lightweight, easy to use, and responsive for both desktop and mobile. It's perfect if you're looking for a movie template to learn from, customize, or even sell as part of your own project.
